*Overview of Approximating Cellular Densities (ArCaDe) Method.* (A) A Nissl image of somatosensory cortex from the Allen Institute's Reference Atlas with exemplar patches overlaid. (B) A demonstration of the fitted polynomial in the presence of noise around the membrane of the cortex. (C) From top to bottom: A patch from the image to visualize the cellular distribution from the top (pia) to the bottom of the cortex (Layer 6). The red lines indicate the transitions between layers as identified by a trained neuroanatomist. Below, detected cell bodies in red overlaid on the same image patch. Next, the estimated density function obtained with our total variation minimization approach.

*Cell detection results on cortical and retinal datasets.* (A) A Nissl-stained visual cortex image from the Allen Institute's Reference Atlas, computed probability maps, and detected cells overlaid on the probability map (red circles). (B) Cell detection results overlaid on a retinal sample in a rd10 mouse (each detected cell is displayed as a different color).

*Evaluation of cytoarchitecture estimation approach.* (A) Synthetic examples of density estimation in noisy data modeled from visual cortex (left) and somatosensory cortex (right). From top to bottom, average density estimate and sparse layer transitions as measured by the total-variation norm (50 trials). (B) Results of density estimation for a patch of cortical data (left) and retinal data (right). From top to bottom: an extracted image patch with annotated layer transitions in red, density estimates, and sparse layer transitions as measured by the total-variation norm.
